Once the CAPs are obtained running the codes in 'kmeans'

1. Run(‘ConvertMasksToMNI.m’) to obtain the GM and WM mask in MNI space per dataset

2. The SVM classification is performed by running 'SVM_classification.m'. This code not only computes and saves
	the mean accuracy of the SVM but also the confusion matrices and the average signal per CAP.

3. The feature extraction is performed by running first 'SVM_feature_1.m' which explores several threshold for 
	the CBR in order to optimize it. 'SVM_feature_2.m' uses the threshold given the best accuracy to 
	obtain the final feature ranking.

	The folder 'SVM-RFE-CBR-v1.3' containing the SVM-RFE code needs to be
	downloaded on https://ch.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50701-feature-selection-with-svm-rfe

4. To plot the confusion matrices, use the code 'plotConfusionMatrices.m'

5. To plot the heatmaps, use the code 'plotHeatmaps.m'

6. The code 'CAP_analysis.m' extracts and plots the frame distribution and the CAPs occurence.
